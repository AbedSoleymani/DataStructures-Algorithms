# DataStructures and Algorithms

This repo is about how to write code to **solve algorithmic problems** and to do so **efficiently** in terms of computation and memory demand.
You're likely aware that computers have the capacity to tackle a wide varity of challengesâ€”ranging from determining optimal travel routes on a map to deciphering the human genome sequence.
However, the methods for problem-solving are rarely unique, with certain approaches offering significantly heightened efficiency compared to others.
Although both of these approaches may resolve the same problem, their execution time can vary greatly, ranging from mere milliseconds to prolonged hours.

How can you analyze a problem and identify multiple potential solutions?
Furthermore, how can you assess the relative efficiency of these approaches?
Will your solution run quickly or slowly?
Will it consume substantial memory space or very small?
Proficiency in addressing such inquiries will make you a more effective software developer.

## Steps to solve an algorithmic problem
1. Carefully specify the **inputs**
2. What are the **outputs**?
3. Understand the **relationship** between inputs/outputs by some examples.
4. Consider **systematically** how a human solves this problem!
5. Forget the implementation details, write a **pseudocode**.
6. Try to develope a simple **mechanical solution**. At this step, do not optimize prematurely! Just find a simple and correct answer.
7. Write the code!
